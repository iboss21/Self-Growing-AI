# Self-Growing AI Project

Welcome to the **Self-Growing AI Project**,
a modular and scalable AI system designed to simulate self-improvement,
learning, and interaction in a controlled environment.
This project is ideal for experimentation, simulation,
and learning how artificial intelligence can evolve.

---

## Features

### Core Modules
1. **Memory System**: 
   - Retains past interactions and retrieves relevant memories for contextual responses.
   - Circular memory storage to manage size efficiently.

2. **Self-Improvement**:
   - Reinforcement learning-based module for skill acquisition and enhancement.
   - Adjustable learning rate for fine-tuning behavior.

3. **Personality Layer**:
   - Configurable tone and emotion simulation.
   - Customizable responses to create unique interaction styles.

4. **Simulation Environment**:
   - A virtual sandbox where the AI can execute tasks and test its abilities (future expansion).

5. **Safe Growth Guardrails**:
   - Ethical checks and daily improvement limits to ensure responsible behavior.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## Configuration

Modify `config.py` to customize the AI's behavior and features:
- **Memory Size**: Adjust the maximum storage capacity for the memory module.
- **Learning Rate**: Change the speed of self-improvement.
- **Personality**: Set tone (`friendly`, `formal`, `philosophical`) and enable/disable emotions.
- **Guardrails**: Define limits for daily updates and ethical checks.

---

## Usage

1. **Interactive Mode**: 
   Start the AI and engage in conversation or assign tasks:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   AI: Hello! I'm your self-growing AI. Ask me anything or give me tasks!
   You: What is your purpose?
   AI: I'm here to learn, grow, and assist you! ðŸ™‚
   ```

2. **Learning**:
   - Assign feedback to the AI using the self-improvement module.
   - Monitor learned skills using `get_skills()`.

3. **Memory**:
   - Save important conversations automatically.
   - Search for past interactions using keywords.

---

## Future Expansions
- **Simulation Environment**: Enable task execution in virtual worlds.
- **Advanced Skills**: Incorporate problem-solving, storytelling, and creativity modules.
- **External APIs**: Integrate tools like OpenAI, Wolfram Alpha, and more for enhanced abilities.
